UEFI boot tools
====================

A collection of scripts to manage UEFI boot menu entries for Ubuntu 
kernels in order to directly boot Ubuntu from a UEFI partition, 
i.e. without using Grub2 altogether.  

Motivation:
Once you activate the "Ultra Fastboot" option in your UEFI firmware
to reduce boot times, all USB keyboards are not activated any more. 
So why lengthen the boot process by loading Grub when you can not
select anything there?

Additionally you can simplify the chain of trust for UEFI Secure Boot.
Only the signed Ubuntu kernel has to be verified with Canonical's key.

Commands
====================

uefi-update-bootmenu: 
  add all kernels in /boot to the UEFI boot menue

uefi-boot2setup:
  trigger boot to UEFI firmware setup on next system boot

uefi-secureboot:
  determine if system was booted in secure boot mode

uefi-select-bootentry:
  select boot menu entry via UI dialog - more comfortable than efibootmgr

zz-update-uefi:
  script to call "uefi-update-bootmenu" after kernel package installs/updates

canonical:
  scripts and keys provided by Canonical to install UEFI secure boot keys for Ubuntu

Installation
====================

1) install UEFI boot tool scripts

  # install command line tools
  sudo cp uefi-* /usr/sbin/

  # install post kernel install/update hook
  echo /etc/kernel/post*.d/ | xargs -n 1 sudo cp zz-update-uefi

2) install secure boot tools and kernel

  # install secure boot tools and kernel
  sudo apt-get install sbsigntool openssl
  sudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64-signed linux-signed-generic
  # install canonical secure boot keys
  cd canonical
  sudo ./canonical/sb-setup enroll canonical
  # fix ownership
  sudo chown -R root.root /etc/secureboot/

3) add Ubuntu kernels to uefi boot menu
  sudo uefi-update-bootmenu

4) enter UEFI firmware setup
  sudo uefi-boot2setup
  sudo shutdown -rf now

5) activate secure boot in your firmware setup and boot again 
  # this step depends on your computers UEFI firmware

6) check if your system was booted using 
  uefi-secureboot
